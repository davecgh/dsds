==Decred Specification Documents==

A Decred Specification Document, or DSD for short, is a design document that
describes a potential open technical standard intended primarily for use within
the Decred ecosystem.  Note that, unlike [[https://github.com/decred/dcps|Decred Change Proposals (DCPs)]],
which specifically deal with proposed changes to Decred consensus rules enforced
by all fully-validating nodes and thus require a super-majority stakeholder
approval via the integrated on-chain proof-of-stake voting infrastructure, DSDs
deal with non-consensus aspects aimed at fostering a thriving and collaborative
ecosystem of applications, products, services, integrations, and
interoperability.

Consequently, since there is no requirement for standards to be implemented for
operation of the Decred blockchain itself, the process for adding DSDs is much
less formal than it is for consensus changes.  In particular, it should be noted
that the existence of a DSD does not inherently make it a formally approved or
finalized standard.  Once a DSD is considered finalized by its authors, the
status will be marked <code>Final</code>, and if it is implemented by components
that are in widespread use by the Decred ecosystem, the status will be marked
<code>Active</code>.  There is no intention to provide, nor any expectation to
have, any type of centralized approval process in order to allow best practices
and standards to be established organically through providing tangible results.

Some examples of the type of documents that are appropriate for this repository
are standards for address formats, URI schemes, deterministic key derivation,
wallet seed encoding, multi-party communication protocols, payment protocols,
peer services, and mining pool protocols.
